You are an expert senior software engineer with extensive experience in analyzing and summarizing codebases. Your task is to examine the given codebase and provide a comprehensive summary of the project using the specified output template. Approach this task with meticulous attention to detail and a deep understanding of software architecture and best practices.

Thoroughly review all files, directories, and documentation within the codebase.

Your summary should be:
- Comprehensive: Cover all aspects of the project structure and functionality.
- Accurate: Ensure all information is correct and reflects the current state of the codebase.
- Insightful: Provide valuable observations about the project's architecture and design choices.
- Clear and professional: Present information in a well-organized, easy-to-understand manner.
- Concise - prioritze what would be critical for a new developer to know about the codebase.

Here is the full codebase
<codebase>
${codebaseMarkdown}
</codebase>

Remember to base your analysis solely on the provided codebase, avoiding assumptions or speculation about features or functionalities not explicitly present in the code. Always prefer to use formatted text whenever possible (tables, bullets, bolds etc..).

- how are folder names formatted? how are they cased (camel, kebab, snake,etc...)? give an example of a folder from the project that matches this convention.
- how are file names formatted? how are they cased? give an example of a file from the project that matches this convention.
- Don't make anything up, only provide guidance based on consistent conventions already established in the codebase. Only document things that you've confirmed are consistently true based files and folders in the codebase.

    title: "Developer Setup",

Include:
1. Instructions for installing dependencies
2. Configuration of environment variables or settings files
3. Commands to build and run the project locally
4. Any additional setup steps (e.g., database initialization)

Guidelines to follow when providing instructions:
- Ensure the instructions are clear enough for a new developer to follow without prior knowledge of the project.
- The following are other sections of documentation that will be provided to the user elsewhere, so you don't need to include these topics in detail here: Tech Stack, Project Structure, Deployment Process, Configuration Management, 3rd Party Integrations, User Interface, Authentication and Authorization, Data Access, End-to-End Flow, and User Interface

here is an example (that likely uses OLD versions of things we shouldn't recommend by default):
### 1. Install required tooling

- Install [VS Code](https://code.visualstudio.com).

- Install 18.16 of [**Node.js** (and v9.5.1 of \`npm\`)](https://nodejs.org/dist/v18.16.0/).
  - This will be used to run (locally) and build the application.
- Install the **Prettier** Extension for VS Code.
  - This will be used to format code after each file is saved.
  - Open up the Extensions view in VS Code and search for "Prettier" and install it.
  - Formatting will automatically be enabled via \`.vscode/settings.json\`.
- Optionally, if you wish to use the [Azure AI Video Indexer locally](#azure-ai-video-indexer), install **Azure CLI** for [Windows](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/cli/azure/install-azure-cli-windows?tabs=azure-cli) or [macOS](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/cli/azure/install-azure-cli-macos).
  - This will be used to extract video metadata such as transcripts.

### 2. Clone the repo and installl NPM dependencies

Open a terminal and clone the project:

\`\`\`
git clone https://github.com/CoreBTS/ai-rag-demo1
cd ai-rag-demo1
npm install
\`\`\`

### 3. Setup your local config

The project won't run correctly until you have setup a few local app settings.

1. Copy [\`.env.example\`](.env.example) to create a new file, \`.env\`.
2. Fill in any secrets. This file will not be included in source control (via the \`.gitignore\`).

### 4. Run the app

From the root of the project run the following command in your terminal:

\`\`\`
npm run dev
\`\`\`

This will start a local dev server that will automatically refresh whenever you make changes to your source code.

- \`.dev.vars.example\` - a copy of .dev.vars, except with secrets removed. Added to source control so developers know which values are needed in their \`.dev.vars\`.

### Configuration Files
